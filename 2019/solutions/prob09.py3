'''
Sam sends encoded messages. Each message begins with a list of code words and 
the corresponding decoded words. You need to decode the message by replacing 
the code word with the decoded word.

Given a string that contains up to 50 word pairs and a second string that 
contains an encoded message, output the decoded message as a string. If the 
code word appears multiple times in the word pairs, only use the first code 
word and decoded word pair.
