Given the boat’s volume (V) in cubic feet, the boat’s weight in pounds, and 
the boat’s desired positive buoyancy percentage (B), determine if the boat’s 
actual buoyancy is same or greater than the desired buoyancy. If so, return 
the string “safe” if same or greater, else return the string “heavy”.
