# MATA High School Programming Contest

Mid-America Technology Alliance (MATA) (matasgf.com) and Hack 4 Good (H4G) (hack4goodsgf.com) began hosting an annual High School Programming Contest (HSPC) in Springfield Missouri.

We publish contest information, problems, and solutions to this repository so that high school teachers and students may better prepare for future/other programming contests. If you find an error or would like to help improve the published solutions, please fork this repository and generate a pull request with your changes.

## Getting Started

Each contest is organized into a separate folder by year. Team Packets and other documents are stored in the year folder. Sample Input/Output files, Secret Input/Output files, and Solutions are stored in the "problems" sub-folder.
