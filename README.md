# MATA High School Programming Contest

Mid-America Technology Alliance (MATA) (matasgf.com) and Hack 4 Good (H4G) (hack4goodsgf.com) began hosting an annual High School Programming Contest (HSPC) in Springfield Missouri in 2017.

Each year, we publish contest information, problems, and solutions to this repository so that high school teachers and students may better prepare for future/other programming contests. If you find an error or would like to help improve the published solutions, please fork this repository and generate a pull request with your changes.

## Getting Started

Each contest is organized into a separate folder by year. Each year contains Team Packets (Practice Problems and Competition Problems), Problem files (Sample Input/Output files and Secret Input/Output files), and Solution files (sample solutions).
